## principles

### do

- if it works, don't break it
- make the difficult problem easy and then solve the easy problem see [decomplication](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/decomplication)
- make it good enough, then move on to the next thing
- optimise for change see [AHA programming](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/aha-programming)
- always jump into context
- move fast with confidence
  - make it good
  - make it fast 
  - make it pretty
- avoid specific knowledge and manual processes
  - write locally, automated checks, internal staging
    - tdd
    - lint
    - auto-format
    - static type check

### avoid

- avoid premature/hasty abstraction see [the wrong abstraction](https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction) and [AHA programming](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/aha-programming)
- avoid foot-guns
- avoid cognitive overload
- avoid design by committee ![](https://github.com/pjsvis/react-patterns/blob/master/images/design-by-committee.png)
